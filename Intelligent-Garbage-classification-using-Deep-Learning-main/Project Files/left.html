            “The accumulation of solid waste in the urban area is becoming a great concern
            , and it would result in environmental pollution and may be hazardous to human
             health if it is not properly managed. It is important to have an advanced/intelligent 
             waste management system to manage a variety of waste materials. One of the most important 
             steps of waste management is the separation of the waste into the different components and
              this process is normally done manually by hand-picking. To simplify the process. 
              We propose an intelligent waste materials classification system, which is developed by 
              using the 50 layer residual net pre-train(ResNet-50) Convolutional Neural network model
              which is a machine learning tool and serves as the extractor and Support Vector Machine 
              (SVM) which is used to classify the waste into different groups/types such as glass metal,
               paper and plastic ect. The proposed system is tested on the trash image dataset  which
                was developed by Gary Thung and Mindly  yang, and is able to achievean accuracy of 87% 
                on the dataset. The separation process of the waste will be faster than intelligent 
                using the proposed waste material classification system without or reducing human 
                involvement. ”
