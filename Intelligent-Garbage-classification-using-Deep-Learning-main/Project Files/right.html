            “The present way of separating waste/garbage is the hand-picking method. where by someone is employed to separate out the different objects/materials. The person, who separate waste, is prone to diseases due to the harmful substances in the garbage. With this in mind ,it motivated us to develop an automated system which is able to sort the waste. And this system can take short time to sort the waste and it will be more accurate in sorting than the manual way. With the system in place, the 
            beneficial separated waste can be recycled and converted to energy and fuel for the growth of the economy. The system that is developed for the separation of the accumulated waste is based on the combination of Convolutional Neural Network. ”
